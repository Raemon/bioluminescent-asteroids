// Pre-baked, GC-free glow trail. Each trailed object owns one Trail; the trail
// records (x, y, age) for the object's recent positions in a fixed-size ring
// buffer and renders them as additive glow stamps with brightness and scale
// driven by a closed-form pulse function of (time, point-index, frequency).
//
// Performance discipline (this module is hot):
//   - Fixed-capacity Float32Array. Never push/shift, never allocate per frame.
//   - No per-point object allocation. Indexing is `i * STRIDE + offset`.
//   - All glow stamps go through the cached sprite in glow.ts (no shadowBlur,
//     no per-frame createRadialGradient).
//   - The caller (Game.render) sets globalCompositeOperation = "lighter" ONCE
//     around the whole trail pass, so render() must not toggle composite mode.
//   - Pulse curves are closed-form sin/cos driven by `time` (milliseconds);
//     we never sample the audio graph for these visuals.
//
// The trail is *not* a particle system: there is no per-point velocity, no
// per-point update loop, no per-point lifetime decay branching. Update only
// stamps a new head and increments a shared sample counter; render walks the
// ring once and stamps one sprite per live sample.
