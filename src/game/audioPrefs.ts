// Player audio preferences: per-channel volume for the four mix groups
//   - basePulse: the background pulsar approach beat (bgBeat).
//   - sfx:       gameplay one-shots (fire, explosions, alien fire, bass kit, …).
//   - music:     combo-halo halo music stems (ambient/melodic/layer3).
//   - vocals:    Pilot's Log captain VO.
//
// Each channel is stored 0..1 in localStorage; Sound applies it as a
//   multiplier on the per-channel gain node. SettingsDialog reads + writes
//   the values and dispatches `audio-pref:changed` so a running Sound
//   instance can update its gain nodes live.
//
// Migration: older builds used `pulsar.vocalsEnabled.v1` ("1"/"0") to toggle
//   vocals on/off. If we see that key on first read we collapse it into the
//   new vocals volume (0 if disabled, 1 if enabled) and leave the legacy key
//   in place (harmless if it's still there).
