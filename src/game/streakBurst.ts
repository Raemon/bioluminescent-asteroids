// Rhythm-streak sparks. Landing successive combo-shots within STREAK_MAX_GAP
// beats of each other grows a ring of comet-sparks riding an orbit around the
// reticule. The seed shot shows nothing — the first spark only appears when a
// 2nd in-window shot confirms the rhythm; only 2nd-and-onward shots count.
// Each spark is a hard white-cored pip head trailing a tapered arc tail, the
// same beat-synced line-work language as the sight it orbits. The ring advances
// in beat TICKS (surging on the downbeat, settling before the next) rather than
// gliding at constant speed; tails stretch longest exactly on the beat. A new
// spark charges on the crosshair and blooms out to its slot on its hit's beat
// center while the older sparks re-space smoothly — nothing teleports. The whole
// ring fades linearly over the extension window and reaches zero exactly when
// the window closes — sparks still visible means the streak can still be
// extended. Ending the streak (a wider gap, a combo loss, or the window
// closing) just clears the ring — each counted shot already paid its escalating
// score bonus on landing (see awardStreakShot in rhythmBonus.ts).
//
// Orbit phase is a pure function of beatTime; the fade + window + birth tween
// are pure functions of perceivedBeatTime (the clock hits are judged on) — no
// RNG anywhere here, so replays reproduce it exactly.
